# Object detection model using Keras

Full implementation of a code to detect kangaroos using Mask-RCNN.  
Implementation steps were followed from the link in the reference.  
Dataset and initial source code taken from the links in the projects.  

Pre-trained weights on the coco dataset can be downloaded from here: [Mask_RCNN_COCO](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=ttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1bLdI1YHAr9Bby6-QlrvEww5SqafFqB_)
